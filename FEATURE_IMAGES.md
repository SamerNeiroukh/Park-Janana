# Image Attachment Feature

This feature allows managers and workers to attach images to tasks for better documentation and communication.

## Features

### Image Upload
- **Multi-select support**: Select multiple images from gallery at once
- **Camera integration**: Take photos directly from within the app
- **Size validation**: Automatic 10MB per image size limit with user feedback
- **Storage organization**: Images saved to Firebase Storage at `storage/tasks/{taskId}/`

### Image Display
- **Thumbnail grid**: 3-column grid layout in task details
- **Full-screen viewer**: Tap thumbnails to view images in full screen with zoom
- **Loading states**: Visual indicators for upload progress
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for failed uploads/loads

### Network Handling
- **Offline support**: Images marked as "pending upload" when offline
- **Retry mechanism**: Failed uploads can be retried
- **Progressive loading**: Thumbnail placeholders while images load
